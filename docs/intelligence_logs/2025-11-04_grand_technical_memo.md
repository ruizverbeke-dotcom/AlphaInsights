\# AlphaInsights — Grand Technical Memo  

\*\*Date:\*\* 2025-11-04  

\*\*Branch:\*\* analytics-module  



---



\## 🧠 Overview

This memo captures the foundational build session for AlphaInsights’ \*\*Memory Infrastructure\*\* — the system that transforms documentation, analytics, and operational events into a persistent knowledge network.



---



\## 🏗️ Work Completed

1\. \*\*Phase 1:\*\* Created full memory folder skeleton under `/docs/`:

&nbsp;  - intelligence\_logs/

&nbsp;  - knowledge\_capsules/

&nbsp;  - progress\_logs/

&nbsp;  - archive/



2\. \*\*Phase 2:\*\* Created and committed core memory files:

&nbsp;  - `context\_tracker.json`

&nbsp;  - `ai\_agents\_spec.md`

&nbsp;  - `knowledge\_capsules/vision\_and\_philosophy.md`

&nbsp;  - `knowledge\_capsules/analytics\_core.md`

&nbsp;  - `knowledge\_capsules/ai\_and\_ml\_roadmap.md`



3\. \*\*Phase 3 (partial):\*\* Began operational memory setup with:

&nbsp;  - `innovation\_sparks.md` — ideation scratchpad for emergent R\&D.

&nbsp;  - `2025-11-04\_grand\_technical\_memo.md` — current documentation log.

\## 🔍 Observations

\- The documentation structure now mirrors AlphaInsights’ analytical logic.

\- Each capsule functions as a self-contained node, maintaining traceability and reproducibility.

\- Folder and filename hygiene verified: all lowercase, aligned with repo policy.

\- Git hygiene intact — no database tracking issues detected.

\## 🚧 Next Steps

1\. Complete \*\*Phase 3\*\* by adding additional progress logs as development continues.  

2\. Proceed to \*\*Phase 4\*\*: version bump and verification of `context\_tracker.json`.  

3\. Integrate capsule cross-referencing once the `KnowledgeAgent` is active.

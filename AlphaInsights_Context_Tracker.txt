CURRENT STATUS LOG

Date: 2025-10-29

- Final stable build successfully completed, committed, and pushed to GitHub.
- Both dashboards (`sharpe_dashboard.py` and `comparison_dashboard.py`) are fully functional and verified locally in Streamlit.
- Fixed the long-standing Plotly “Data must be 1-dimensional” bug via np.ravel() flattening and Series normalization.
- Implemented shape-safe handling for all return and benchmark data; no residual runtime errors.
- Confirmed correct functioning of: rolling Sharpe Ratio, cumulative growth comparison, and daily return histograms.
- Branch `analytics-module` now properly tracks the remote branch on GitHub.
- Project confirmed clean (`git status` = working tree clean) and synced — this is the official restore point.

Next step:
→ Optional: refine UI styling (fonts, colors, metric cards) and interlink dashboards for unified navigation.
→ After that, begin integrating backend analytics and database modules.
